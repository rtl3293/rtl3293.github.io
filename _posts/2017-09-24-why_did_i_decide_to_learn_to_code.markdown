Learning to code is something I've wanted to do for a long time. One of my largest passions for a long time has been technology, smartphones in particular. I've worked retail in the wireless industry for 5 years now, and have just loved watching what technology can do to help people. 

**I'm tired of not helping. **

I'm excited to be able to take on this challenge. I plan on using the skills on learn here to make a change. Even if it's for just one more person than I couldn't have elsewhere. Code is a way to reach people across the world, and make a change one line at a time.
